# s2r

A toy but my first compiler, implemented in Rust, which convert SysY programming language to RISC-V assembly based on Koopa IR.

## Progress

- Expression - ✅
- Constants and variables - ✅
- Block and scope - ✅
- if/else - ✅
- while/for - ✅
- Function and global variables - ✅
- Arrays - ✅
- Optimization

## Unimplemented features

Keep track of the things I'm interested in, but have no time to start or finish.

- Add syntax highlight
- Add custom LSP support
- More constant folding (Untouched variable, modified variable, function, etc..)
