# s2r

A toy but my first compiler, implemented in Rust, which convert SysY programming language to RISC-V assembly, with Koopa IR support.

## Progress

- Expression - ✅
- Constants and variables - ✅
- Block and context
- if/else
- while/for
- Function and global variables
- Arrays
- Optimization

## Unimplemented features

Keep track of the things I'm interested in, but have no time to start or finish.
